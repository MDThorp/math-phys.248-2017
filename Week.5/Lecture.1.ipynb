    "\n",
    "The qualifier in the above sentence is rather important. There are many basic algebraic tasks that are *non-computable*, in the sense that we have proofs that it is *impossible* to write a computer program that computes the answer to certain algebraic problems.  A closely related fact is that many differential equations do not have closed-form solutions, i.e. their solutions are not expressible in terms of [*elementary functions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function). \n",
    "\n",
    "These issues lead to certain unavoidable problems in symbolic computation.  For some tasks, Sympy has effective algorithms that give useful answers in a reliable manner.  But for other kinds of problems, Sympy will *try* to answer your query, but there are *no* estimates for how long it might take, *nor* how much system memory it will require to complete the task you have asked of it.  In effect sympy may or may not give you an answer to these kinds of requests. \n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sympy has a systematic way of solving algebraic equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * At its core is a strong semi-algorithm to solve systems of polynomial equations.\n",
    "     - An example system: $x^3+3xy+1=0 = y^4-x^2y+x+4 $\n",
    "     - To solve such equations Sympy uses a **Groebner basis algorithm** to convert such systems of *multi-variable polynomial* equations into systems of *single-variable* polynomial equations. This is a reliable algorithm, although it can be slow (double-exponential run-time estimates).\n",
    "     - Sympy does not know how to write \"closed-form\" solutions to all single variable polynomial equations, but it has a significant repository of closed-form solutions, as we have seen. \n",
    "     - As a side-note, it is *known* that the solutions to a general degree $5$ (or higher) polynomial equation $a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=0$ can not be expressed as a rational polynomial in rational powers (recursively) of $a_5,\\cdots,a_0$, although as we have seen above this **can** be done if the degree is $4$ or less.   So one generally *can not* hope for simple formulas for such roots.\n",
    "\n",
    " * For more complicated systems, such as $\\sin(x)^3+3\\sin(x)\\cos(y)+1=0=\\sin(y)^4-\\cos(x)^2+\\cos(x)+4$ sympy thinks of the system as a polynomial equation in the variables $\\sin(x), \\cos(y)$ and computes $\\sin^{-1}$ and $\\cos^{-1}$ of the solutions.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Sympy also has adapted versions of the above algorithms to find closed-form solutions to some differential equations.  We will talk more about this when we discuss simulating solutions to differential equations.  One particularly simple case appears below."
