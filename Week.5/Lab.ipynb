    "Using this scheme implement an algorithm to solve the ordinary differential equation that describes the velocity as a function of time $v(t)$ for a skydiver jumping from a plane at $h=2000\\mathrm{m}$. Provide a plot for the velocity from the jump-off height to $h_\\mathrm{p} = 300\\mathrm{m}$, which is the height at which the skydiver will release her parachute. Your plot should include a line for the analytically determined terminal velocity. Perform a convergence study by doing a series of 3 to 4 runs with decreasing step size 0.\n",

    "Please remember the instructions from the Lab in Week 2 on how to approach a programming task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sketch out the algorithm you want to use. This involves some kind of flow-diagram and writing out the program in pseudo-programing language.\n",
    "2. Implement algorithm; while you write it add reasonable comments, short and relevant.\n",
    "3. Run algorithm and generate results.\n",
    "4. Test the program carefully. What can you do to convince yourself that your algorithm is working correctly?"
