    "# Implicit solutions to coupled systems of ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "With the linear algebra techniques of solving coupled systems of equations we can now construct solutions to coupled ODEs. As an example we will write a nuclear network code. Such networks exhibit an ODE behaviour that is called _stiff_. Coefficients in stiff ODE systems have a very large range, which implies that the explicit solution scheme we have used so far would demand taking very small time steps to calculate details of the solutions that are not relevant. The solution is to adopt an implicit scheme. It involves numerical root-finding with the Newton-Raphson method. \n",

    "If the there is only one independent variable we have just a one-dimensional problem. The Newton-Raphson method is a robust and easy method to find the root of a function. It has very fast convergence if there is a good initial guess, but it has - like other methods - several pathologies that one needs to be aware off. One of its advantages is that it does generalize to multiple dimensions in a straight-forward way. \n",
