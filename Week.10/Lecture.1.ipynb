    "The physics of this problem involves two aspects:\n",
    "1. Kirchhoff current law (a conservation law): The sum of all currents at any junction points must be zero.\n",
    "2. Ohm's law: The relation between current $I$, voltage $V$ and resistance is $$R = \\frac{V}{I}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the non-physicists - these fundamental electricitiy problems can be best understood in terms of the water analogy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Set up equations\n",
    "* The current between two junctions is given by the voltage difference divided by the resistance (Ohm's law).\n",
    "* For each junction the sum of the currents into (or out of) the junction must be zero, i.e. in the voltage differences must contain the voltage at the junction with the same sign \n",
    "* Since the resistance is the same for all resistors it cancels and I we can ommit it right from the beginning. \n",
