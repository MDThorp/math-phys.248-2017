    "###  The unix command line\n",
    "\n",
    "#### the shell\n",
    "The program that provides the command line (not all of the commands) is the shell. A common shell is `bash`. Try `> man bash`. The command line is a unix process. Launching a command on the command line interface (CLI) spawns a child process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### file manipulation\n",
    "```\n",
    "  emacs, vi (more powerful) or nano \n",
    "  more/less/tail/head\n",
    "  cat\n",
    "  touch\n",
    "  cp\n",
    "  rm\n",
    "  grep\n",
    "  wc (-l)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### file system\n",
    "```\n",
    "  ls (-l, many other options)\n",
    "  cd  (. or .. or ~ or actual directory)\n",
    "  pwd\n",
    "  mkdir\n",

    "#### helpful commands\n",
    "```\n",
    "  man (command)\n",
    "  history\n",

    "\n",
    "#### networking\n",

    "  ps\n",
    "  pipes and filters: use | to pipe between command, use > to redirect output\n",
    "```\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### customizing your CLI\n",
    "You can define variables and aliases in the .bashrc file. The details on how this is set up depends on the particular Linux/Unix/Mac flavour.\n",

    "```\n",
    "   alias\n",
    "   environment variables\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### shell scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "You can combine a sequence of shell commands into a file and use as a shell script. You have to make the file with the script executable (`chmod u+x file_name.sh`). See file `example.sh` in the [example directory](https://github.com/fherwig/physmath248_pilot/blob/master/examples/example.sh).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resources\n",

    "\n",
    "**Homework:** unix command cheat sheet\n",
    "Familiarize yourself with the CLI, e.g. follow through online resources. Work in a team! Help each other! Look up each command using the `man` command, remind yourself what the command does, try it out, and create a brief reference page for yourself. It should look like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls - list files and directories\n",
    "mv - move file or directory to different place\n",

    "- create a directory and go into it\n",
    "- create a text file (with touch), edit it with the CLI editor of your choice to fill it with the names of lots of people you know\n",
    "- move the file to another name.\n",
    "- how many lines does it have?\n",
    "- search through the file for all incidences of a particular letter or string, and count them with 'wc'\n",
    "- use 'man' to look at the various options for 'grep', and then look for lines that do NOT have the letter 'e' in it.\n",
    "- go up one directory, and use 'du -h' on 1) the entire directory tree, and 2) just the new directory.\n",
    "- use 'man' to look at the options for 'rm', and then delete *ONLY* the entire directory you just created in one command.\n",
    "- use 'history' to see what you just did!\n",
