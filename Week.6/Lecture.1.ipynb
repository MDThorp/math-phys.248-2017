    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Sympy has a systematic way of solving algebraic equations.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * At its core is a strong semi-algorithm to solve systems of polynomial equations.\n",
    "     - An example system: $x^3+3xy+1=0 = y^4-x^2y+x+4 $\n",
    "     - To solve such equations Sympy uses a **Groebner basis algorithm** to convert such systems of *multi-variable polynomial* equations into systems of *single-variable* polynomial equations. This is a reliable algorithm, although it can be slow (double-exponential run-time estimates).\n",
    "     - Sympy does not know how to write \"closed-form\" solutions to all single variable polynomial equations, but it has a significant repository of closed-form solutions, as we have seen. \n",
    "     - As a side-note, it is *known* that the solutions to a general degree $5$ (or higher) polynomial equation $a_5x^5+a_4x^4+a_3x^3+a_2x^2+a_1x+a_0=0$ can not be expressed as a rational polynomial in rational powers (recursively) of $a_5,\\cdots,a_0$, although as we have seen above this **can** be done if the degree is $4$ or less.   So one generally *can not* hope for simple formulas for such roots.\n",
    "\n",
    " * For more complicated systems, such as $\\sin(x)^3+3\\sin(x)\\cos(y)+1=0=\\sin(y)^4-\\cos(x)^2+\\cos(x)+4$ sympy thinks of the system as a polynomial equation in the variables $\\sin(x), \\cos(y)$ and computes $\\sin^{-1}$ and $\\cos^{-1}$ of the solutions.\n",
    " \n",
    " * Sympy also has adapted versions of the above algorithms to find closed-form solutions to some differential equations.  We will talk more about this when we discuss simulating solutions to differential equations.  One particularly simple case appears below.\n",

    " * * *\n",

    "## Sympy and ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "Sympy's algorithms for finding *anti-derivatives* have been adapted to algorithms for finding *closed-form* solutions to differential equations.  \n",
