For example, using a least-squares library call that does not compute the fit that you desire. \n",

    "We expect you to *document* your code in this course.  Generally speaking, what this means is we expect to see some words of commented-out text (using either a '''*docstring*''' or the comment symbol \\#) where you explain what the code *does*, what *input* it expects, and what *output* it gives.  Particular attention should be made for usability -- if there are any issues.  For example, if you are documenting a function, is there any input for which your function fails?  Uses enormous amounts of memory?  Or is noticably slow?  \n",
