    "## Homework Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we ask you to further investigate the crime statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [Lecture 2, Week 8](../Week.8/Lecture.2.ipynb) we did a PCA analysis of the crime data where we did daily counts of crimes, *binned* by crime type.  In this assignment we ask you to start your analysis using a few other binning techniques.  We will then ask you to investigate the results, making plots of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem 1)** Do a PCA analysis where you bin the data into $86*6=516$ bins. There are $86$ crime types, and six $4$-hour periods in a day:\n",
    " - midnight to 4am\n",
    " - 4am to 8am\n",
    " - 8am to noon\n",
    " - noon to 4pm\n",
    " - 4pm to 8pm\n",
    " - 8pm to midnight\n",
    " \n",
    "Thus, for every day, we will have a $516$-component vector that describes the counts of the various crime types in each $4$-hour period.  \n",
    "\n",
    " 1a) Do PCA analysis on this *binning* of the data.  For the pre-grading script, please print your **explained_variance__**. \n",
    "\n",
    " 1b) Interpret the first four largest eigenvectors.  If the crimes types corellate, what if any relation is there between them? If there is an inverse corellation, what might be the cause of this inverse corellation?\n",
    " \n",
    " Things to consider (for problems 1,2,3):\n",
    "  - Do the crimes happen in different locations?  A heat map would help with this. \n",
    "  - Do the crime happen  at different times?  A plot might help with this. \n",
    "  - If you notice any strong trends (corellation or inverse-corellation), perhaps make a plot and try a least-squares interpolation. \n",
