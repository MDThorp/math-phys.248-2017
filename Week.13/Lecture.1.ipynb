    "Computer images (in particular **.png** files) are stored as $r \\times c \\times 3$ arrays of floating-point numbers.  $r$ represents the rows, $c$ the columns and the $3$ is for the *red*, *green* and *blue* colour fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Representing a picture in this format is good for adjusting colour levels, converting to grayscale, etc.  But it is not particularly useful for resizing the image.  Or extracting features such as transitions, or edge detection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More afield, the subject of *computer vision* looks for techniques of automatically extracting information from images.  Think of products like *Google glass*, it is something of an attempt at a heads-up-display like in the Iron Man movie.  Its goal is to be an assistant, to identify products, people, dangers, etc. "
