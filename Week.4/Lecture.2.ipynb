The following introduces an actual multiprocessing approach that will use multiple of your cpu cores. The work is too small to notice any difference in performance though.

    "## Falling body with drag\n",
    "\n",
    "A falling body - say a sky diver - will increase speed when she jumps off the plane because she is accelerated by the earth's gravity. However, the speed will not increase forever. In addition to the gravitational force the sky diver will feel the drag force due to air resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the terminal velocity of the sky diver? This will depend on the balance of two forces: the gravitational force and the drag force that describes the air resistance\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equation of motion\n",
    "The equation of motion for the velocity is $v = a t +v_0$ where $a$ is the acceration and $v_0$ the initial velocity. But this is of course just a special case of the more general case\n",
    "$$\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = \\sum \\vec{F}_i .$$\n",

This method is based on the principle that every physics equation must be dimensionally homogeneous, i.e. the units on each side of the equation must be the same. We are looking for a force, which has the unit \n",

You can easily confirm that this is the case if $a=1$, $b=2$ and $c=1.$ Convention has it that we throw in another factor $\\frac{1}{2}$ and the  resulting expression for the drag force is \n",

Our sky diver will certainly reach velocities of the order of $100\\mathrm{km/hr}$ and a characteristic length scale would be $1\\mathrm{m}$. Therefore:\n",

Experiments show how the drag coefficient depends on the $Re$ number, [see for example here](http://www.chem.mtu.edu/~fmorriso/DataCorrelationForSphereDrag2013.pdf) or any text book on fluid dynamics.
